# FilmQueryProject

## Details
The FilmQueryProject is all about integrating MySQL and Java. This project uses a fairly large MySQL database, which is accessed through a Java program that uses a scanner to take input from terminal (user) to query the database for user requested information.

## Project Details
The database this project uses includes data based on a film rental store. It contains detailed information regarding each film, including actors and a description. The database also holds info about staff, and customers of multiple store locations, and tracking regarding film rentals.
This project is built to allow the user to access information of a film specified by either a film id, or based on a keyword query. The user receives the information regarding their desired film or films in a readable and concise format.

## Project Build Takeaways
As a Java developer, this is was my first hands on interaction with coupling a database and Java. It was a challenging but fun program to build. I am coming away from this with a solid understanding about how to leverage data, not only as it applies to databases, but also Java code.
